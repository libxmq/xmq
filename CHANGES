Added commands: to-clines quote-c unquote-c

Use to-clines for printing greppable lines: xmq test.xmq to-clines

alfa(A) {
    empty
    'Hejsan'
    beta = hoppsan
    'Svejsan'
}

outputs:

/alfa/@A=""
/alfa/empty=""
/alfa="Hejsan"
/alfa/beta="hoppsan"
/alfa="Svejsan"

The right hand side is an ansi-c quoted string probably compatible with json.

You can quote/unquote ansi-c strings like this:
echo -ne "hello\nworld!" | xmq --text quote-c to-text
outputs:
"hello\nworld!"

echo '"hello\nworld!"' | ./xmq --text unquote-c to-text
outputs:
hello
world!
