Omoeba helped improve the configure and installation scripts! Thanks Omoeba!

2024-12-08: Version 3.1.1

Steven Pemberton noticed that xmq wrongly reported some IXML grammars
as ambiguous even though they weren't. This is now fixed. Thanks Steven!

2024-12-08: Version 3.1.0

The IXML parser can now parse the ixml grammar itself.
Added grammars/core/tsv.ixml to parse tab separated value files.

Use it like for example like this:
xmq --ixml=grammars/core/tsv.ixml tabbed_input.txt to-xml > values.xml

2024-12-07: Version 3.0.0

XMQ now supports invisible XML (IXML). Read https://invisiblexml.org/

Try:
xmq --ixml=grammar.ixml input_file

or for quicker testing, the input can be provided as an argument:
xmq --ixml=grammar.ixml -i 'text to parse'

The implementation of the IXML standard is not yet complete,
but it has reached a useful state!

Then run: xmq source.json transform dostuff.xslj to-json
