2025-01-16: Version 3.2.2

Fix bug in IXML grammar where rule alias was lost for alternatives.

Explanation, given the rule:
myrule>myalias = 'alfa' | 'beta'.

If matched against 'alfa' then the produced rule was named myalias.
If matched against 'beta' then the produced rule was named myrule.
After bug-fix the produced rule is always myalias.
