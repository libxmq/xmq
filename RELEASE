2025-01-03: Release 3.2.0

You can now print all href attributes in a web page:

xmq index.html select //a/@href

You can now compose a new web page with all the svg images found
and view this page in your default browser:

xmq index.html select //svg add-root body add-root html to-html br

You can of course do the same with img tags for pages that
have src references beginning with https:.
