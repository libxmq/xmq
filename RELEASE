Add support for double quotes in xmq to mirror to single quotes.
msg = "There's a value."
msg = """There's a "value"."""

Add support for automatic download of ixml/xslt files. E.g.

xmq ixml:data/csv myfile.csv xslt:data/table-to-web to-html br

This command will download csv.ixml and table-to-web.xslq
and apply them to the myfile.csv and view the resulting
table in your default browser. The ixml/xslt files are then
cached locally.

The library of ixml/xslt files can be found in the git repo.
Please contribute ixml/xslt files!
