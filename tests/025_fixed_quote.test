# It is assumed to have the same base indentation as the found incidental indentation.
# Most lexers (and ixml) cannot track the column number when grabbing tokens
# so we cannot use the actual source code indentation here. We can only
# know the second (and further lines indentation.
# So here we assume that x is equially indented as z.
